# Linear Regression on Advertising data
Overview <br>
Linear Regression is a repository designed for learning the basics of machine learning, specifically focusing on linear regression. This project provides a hands-on approach to understand how linear regression works using a sample dataset. <br>

## Contents


`Advertising.xls`: Dataset used for training the model.<br>
`app.py`: Script for running the linear regression model.<br>
`mymodel.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the model training process.<br>
`mymodel.pkl`: Serialized model file.<br>
`requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.<br>

## Installation


1.Clone the repository:<br>
Copy code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tadano13/LinearrReg5.git
cd LinearrReg5`
```
Install dependencies:<br>
